Brief description of Comparator-LED subsystem: This subsystem comprises of three comparator-LED configurations that are designed in such a way to ouput a voltage of
over 0.7 Volts to each LED based on the output data of the TMP135 temperature sesnor. The first comparator configuration outputs a high voltage resulting in the LED
displaying when Vdata (Voltage output of TMP135) is in the range of 0 - 20 degrees celcius respectively. The second configuration outputs a high to the second LED 
when the temperature is in the range 20 - 40 degrees clecius, and the third when the temperature is in the range 40 degrees celcius and above. In the case of 40 
degrees clecius and above, all three LED's are displaying.
