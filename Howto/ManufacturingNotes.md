**Manufacturing Notes for LM135 PiHat**

A step by step process of manufacturing your own LM135 tempreture sensor PiHat

1. Carefully select your PCB manufacturer
Research for nearby manufacturers, and find one which you believe is reliable
enough to manufacture your PCB.
You should then get quotes on the manufacturing price of the PCB and find which best suit your budget.


2. In order to recieve quotes or begin the manufacturing process you will need to submit the following files:
	* Gerber Files which can be found using the link below
	https://github.com/TainedeBlaze/3088-PiHat-project/tree/main/PCB%20and%20Gerber%20Files
	
	* Centroid files which can be found using the following link:

	* Bill of materials whcih can be found using the following link:
	https://github.com/TainedeBlaze/3088-PiHat-project/tree/main/PCB's%20Bill%20Of%20Materials

Once you have submitted these files you should be able to manufacture your own PiHat tempreture sensor.
