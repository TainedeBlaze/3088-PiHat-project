brief description of what our PiHat does: 
We have designed a temperature sensor piHat, that will be able to measure the temperature of anything from a liquid to the ambient room temperature, and convey this temperature through a set out LED outputs. Each LED can be configured to turn on for when the temperature surpasses a designated threshold. This is done through a comparator op amp configuration and potentiometers for each LED. The circuit has 3 subsysetms, a voltage regulator that sets the voltage going into the LEDs, the temperature sensor itself, and the output LEDs which also have a status LED that shows whether the piHat is recieving power.
