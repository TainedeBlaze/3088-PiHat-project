Brief description of LM135 temperature sensor subsystem: This subsystem is comprised of the TMP135 temperature sensor which has its input (powering terminal) 
connected to the output of of the buck boost regulator subsystem, and its output (Vdata) connected to the comparator-LED subsystem. The TMP335 temperature sensor at
0℃ outputs 2.73V, increasing by 10mV/℃.
